# Gender-Recognition-on-FPGA
The gender of the person can be detected by using the facial parameters. 
The parameters such as eyes, jaw, hair, eye brows, and lips are used to detect the gender of the person in the image. 
The Mat Lab is used to detect the gender of the person in a saved image. 
The code generated on Mat Lab is then operated on Real-Time basis with the help of National Instrumentâ€™s myRio FPGA Kit. 
The Lab VIEW is used to interface the Mat Lab with FPGA Kit. 
Supporting devices include web cam to acquire the image, LCD to display the result and push button switch to take the image. 
Gender detection on FPGA has numerous applications in the area of security and surveillance, human-computer intelligent interaction, and smart environment. 
The proposed method can be further evaluated in the future by using different database and considering more facial parameters.
